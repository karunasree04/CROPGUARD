# CROPGUARD
CropGuard AI: AI-Powered Crop Health Monitoring System
Project Overview
CropGuard AI is an advanced agricultural monitoring solution developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2025. It leverages cutting-edge multispectral and hyperspectral imaging technology combined with IoT sensor data to provide early detection and real-time monitoring of crop health, soil conditions, and pest risks. By enabling the detection of crop diseases and stress factors 4 to 5 days before visual symptoms appear, CropGuard AI aims to empower farmers with actionable insights to protect and enhance crop yields sustainably.

Key Features
Early Disease Detection: Utilizes multispectral/hyperspectral drone imagery processed through deep learning models (CNN, LSTM) achieving over 90% accuracy in identifying crop diseases and stress.

IoT Sensor Network: Integrates diverse sensors (VOC gases, ultrasonic vibrations, soil moisture and nutrient levels) to monitor plant health and soil conditions continuously.

Real-Time Alerts: Automated notifications delivered via mobile app and SMS ensure farmers receive timely alerts, enabling rapid intervention and reducing potential crop damage.

Precision Agriculture: Data-driven treatment recommendations minimize pesticide use by up to 40%, optimize resource allocation, and increase crop yield by approximately 25-30%.

User-Centric Design: Multilingual, farmer-friendly interfaces accessible via mobile and desktop dashboards facilitate monitoring and decision-making.

Scalable & Offline-Ready: Designed to operate effectively in rural areas with intermittent internet, supporting scalability across diverse crops and geographic regions.

Technical Architecture
Data Acquisition: Multispectral and hyperspectral cameras mounted on drones collect high-resolution spectral images capturing crop reflectance beyond visible light, revealing early stress markers invisible to the naked eye.

AI & Machine Learning: MATLAB and Python-based frameworks deploy convolutional neural networks and temporal models to analyze spectral and sensor data, identifying anomalies predictive of disease onset.

IoT Integration: Sensors stream real-time environmental data to cloud platforms (ThingSpeak) for aggregation and fusion with imaging data.

Alert and Visualization: A robust backend processes insights and triggers alerts; frontend applications visualize crop health trends, sensor readings, and predictive analytics.

Cloud Infrastructure: Cloud-hosted services enable scalable data processing, model training, and dashboard hosting, with offline capabilities for field conditions.

Impact & Benefits
Agricultural Productivity: Early detection reduces crop losses by an estimated 80%, lowering pest and disease impacts significantly.

Cost Efficiency: Reduction in pesticide and chemical usage by 40% leads to lower operational costs and less environmental impact.

Sustainability: Encourages sustainable farming practices aligned with global food security goals (SDG 2: Zero Hunger).

Empowering Farmers: Enhances farmersâ€™ capacity to undertake precision agriculture through accessible, timely, and actionable data insights.

Policy Support: Facilitates government and NGO interventions through aggregated field-level health monitoring.

Installation & Usage Guidelines
